 * # Append/Prepend data for the key
 * Commands "incr" and "decr" are used to change data for some item in-place, incrementing or decrementing it. The data
 * for the item is treated as decimal representation of a 64-bit unsigned integer.  If the current data value does not
 * conform to such a representation, the incr/decr commands return an error. Also, the item must already exist for
 * incr/decr to work; these commands won't pretend that a non-existent key exists with value 0; instead, they will fail.
 *
 * Command must write result to the output, which could be:
 * - "NOT_FOUND", to indicate the item with this value was not found
 * - "<value>" where <value> is the new value of the item's data, after the increment/decrement operation was carried
 * out.
